      <u>kindness</u> is a type of behavior marked by acts of
      <mark>generosity</mark>, consideration, rendering assistance, or concern
      for others, without expecting praise or reward in return. is a topic of
      interest in philosophy, <em>religion</em>, and psychology. Kindness was
      one of the main topics in the Bible. In Book II of Rhetoric, Aristotle
      defines kindness as "helpfulness towards someone in need, not in return
      for anything, nor for the advantage of the helper himself, but for that of
      the person helped".[1] Friedrich Nietzsche considered kindness and love to
      be the "most curative herbs and agents in human intercourse".[2] Kindness
      is one of the Knightly Virtues.[3] In Meher Baba's teachings, God is
      synonymous with kindness: "God is so kind that it is impossible to imagine
      His unbounded kindness!"[4]
